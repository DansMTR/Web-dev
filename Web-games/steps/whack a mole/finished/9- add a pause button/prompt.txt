Edit the code of a whack-a-mole project to add a full pause/resume system. In the HTML, add a pause button with the ID "pause-button" in the game info section. In JavaScript, implement an isPaused state and a togglePause() function to handle pausing and resuming. When paused, stop the timer, hide moles, clear timeouts, and change the button text to "Resume." When resumed, restart the timer, accurately calculate remaining game time, and set new timeouts. Disable game controls while paused and reset the pause state when the game ends. Style the pause button in CSS to match existing buttons.
