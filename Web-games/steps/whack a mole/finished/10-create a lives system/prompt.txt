Edit the code of a whack-a-mole project to add a lives system. In the HTML, create a visual display for lives using heart emojis. In JavaScript, implement a lives counter starting at 5, update the display with a function, and trigger life loss when a mole disappears without being whacked. The game ends when all lives are lost or the timer runs out. Add visual feedback by changing hearts from ‚ù§Ô∏è to üñ§ and include a shake animation when a life is lost. Update the game over screen and history log to display remaining lives.
