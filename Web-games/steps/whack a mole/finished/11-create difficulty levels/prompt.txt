Edit the code of a whack-a-mole project to add difficulty levels. Create a difficulty selector that appears when clicking "Start Game" or "Retry." Implement three levels: Easy (slower moles, 40-second game, 7 lives), Medium (medium-speed moles, 30-second game, 5 lives), and Hard (fast moles, 25-second game, 3 lives). Adjust the mole speed, game duration, and lives based on the selected difficulty. Ensure the game updates accordingly when a difficulty level is chosen.
