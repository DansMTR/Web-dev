Edit the code of a whack-a-mole project to improve visual enhancements, including a modern gradient background, improved typography with Google Fonts, and 3D button effects. Add smoother mole animations, a custom cursor for hovering over holes, and visual feedback for hits, score increases, and losing lives. Enhance the UI with better-organized game info, difficulty buttons with descriptions, and a styled score history panel. Improve gameplay with a pop-up mole effect, better pause button appearance, and pulsing start button animation. Ensure responsive design for mobile devices and add a credits footer.
