Edit the code of a whack-a-mole project to add a game over screen. In the HTML, include a game over screen div with a final score display. In JavaScript, modify the whack() function to increment the score only if clicking on an active mole, and implement a clickHole() function to trigger game over when clicking an empty hole. Create an endGame() function to handle the game over state and update the timeout handler to use this function. Add event listeners to the holes for click detection. In the CSS, style the game over screen with a smooth transition, make it initially hidden, and use a .visible class to display it when needed.
