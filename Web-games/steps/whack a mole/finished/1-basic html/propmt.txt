Create the core HTML structure for a Whack-a-Mole game. The page should include a title and a main heading labeled 'Whack-a-Mole'. Add a 'Start Game' button to initiate the game. Design a game board with a 3x3 grid layout containing nine holes, each with a hidden mole inside. Ensure each hole has a unique ID for later manipulation via JavaScript. Link an external CSS file for styling and a JavaScript file for game functionality. Keep the structure clean and organized to allow future improvements.
