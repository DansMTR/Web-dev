Edit the code of a hangman guessing game to create a clean, responsive layout. Add a game container featuring a title heading, an attempts counter starting at 6, a word display area for showing underscores and guessed letters, and a status message area for game feedback. Include an interactive alphabet keyboard with buttons for A-Z and a "New Game" button to reset the game. Apply appropriate styling to ensure a cohesive and user-friendly design.
