Edit the code of a whack-a-mole project to add a score history log. In the HTML, add a sidebar for the history log with a scrollable container. In CSS, style the sidebar with a card-like appearance and ensure responsive design. In JavaScript, track game results in an array and implement functions to update and display the history. Limit the history to 50 entries and enable auto-scrolling to show the latest entry. The history will reset with each page reload or server restart.
