Implement the core JavaScript functionality for the Whack-a-Mole game. Select all holes and moles from the document and add a start button event listener. Create a function to randomly select a hole and make the mole appear for a short duration before disappearing. Ensure the game continues spawning moles while it is active. Implement a startGame function that disables the start button, initiates mole appearances, and sets a game timer (e.g., 30 seconds). When the timer ends, stop the game and re-enable the start button. Ensure smooth transitions between mole appearances for a fun and interactive experience.
