Style the Whack-a-Mole game with a nature-inspired theme. Center the game container and apply a brown-green color scheme. Design a 3x3 grid for the game board, ensuring holes are circular and evenly spaced. The 'Start Game' button should have a smooth hover effect. The mole should remain hidden by default and smoothly transition upwards when it appears. Ensure the design is responsive and visually engaging
