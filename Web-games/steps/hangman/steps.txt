I'll create a similar task breakdown for a Word Guessing Game (Hangman style). Here's a structured approach to developing this project:
Basic Structure & Functionality

Create the Basic HTML Structure – Set up the HTML file with a title, heading, word display area with underscores for letters, and an alphabet keyboard.
Style the Game with CSS – Design the game interface with styles for the word display, keyboard buttons, and overall layout.
Implement the Word Selection Logic – Write JavaScript to randomly select a word from a predefined list when the game starts.
Create the Letter Guessing Mechanism – Add event listeners to detect when a player clicks a letter and reveal the letter in the word if correct.

Enhancing the Game

Add a Wrong Guesses Counter – Track and display the number of incorrect guesses, limiting the total allowed mistakes.
Implement Visual Feedback – Create a hangman drawing or other visual element that progressively appears with each wrong guess.
Add a Game Over Screen – Display "You Win" or "You Lose" messages and the correct word when the game ends.
Create Difficulty Levels – Allow players to choose easy, medium, or hard modes that affect word length and complexity.

Adding More Features

Implement Word Categories – Add different word categories (animals, countries, foods) that players can select.
Create a Hint System – Give players the option to reveal a hint about the word at the cost of an extra wrong guess.
Add a Timer Option – Include a countdown timer mode for added challenge.
Enable Keyboard Controls – Allow players to guess letters using their physical keyboard.
Implement Score Tracking – Store and display highest scores using local storage.
Create a Word Suggestion Feature – Allow users to submit new words to be added to the game.
Add Sound Effects – Include audio feedback for correct/incorrect guesses and game outcomes.
