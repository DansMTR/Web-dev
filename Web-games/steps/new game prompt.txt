Word Guessing Game (Hangman style) - Guess a hidden word one letter at a time

i need to this as a small web developement project in html js and css 

i need you to divide it into small tasks like this :

Basic Structure & Functionality

Create the Basic HTML Structure – Set up the HTML file with a title, heading, game board with holes, and a start button.

Style the Game with CSS – Design the game board using CSS to create mole holes, the moles themselves, and layout the game interface.

Implement the Mole Appearance Logic – Write JavaScript to make moles randomly appear from holes at different intervals.

Create the Whacking Mechanism – Add event listeners to detect when a player clicks on a mole and hide the mole when clicked.

Enhancing the Game

Add a Score System – Track and display the player's score, adding points when successfully whacking a mole.

Implement a Timer – Create a countdown timer for game rounds (e.g., 30 seconds per round).

Add a Game Over Screen – Display final score and option to play again when the timer runs out.

Create Difficulty Levels – Allow players to choose easy, medium, or hard modes that affect mole speed and frequency.

Adding More Features

Implement Multiple Mole Types – Add different types of moles (regular moles, fast moles, bonus moles) with different point values.

Create a Lives System – Give players a certain number of lives, losing one when they miss a mole.

Add a Combo System – Award bonus points for consecutive successful whacks.

Enable Keyboard Controls – Allow players to whack moles using keyboard keys corresponding to hole positions.

Implement High Score Tracking – Store and display the highest scores using local storage.

Create Level Progression – Increase difficulty automatically as the player reaches certain score thresholds.

Add Special Power-ups – Include random power-ups like time extensions or temporary score multipliers.
