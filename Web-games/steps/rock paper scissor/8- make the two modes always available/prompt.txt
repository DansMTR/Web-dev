Modify the game to allow players to choose between two game modes: Player vs. Player (PvP) and Player vs. Computer (PvC). Add a mode selection menu where players can select which mode to play. Ensure the game updates correctly depending on the chosen mode: in PvP mode, both players take turns selecting their choices, while in PvC mode, the computer picks a random choice after Player 1 selects. Keep Player 1â€™s choice hidden in PvP mode until Player 2 picks. Ensure the game resets properly and test the update to confirm both modes work as expected.
