Develop the core HTML structure for a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Include a title (<title>) and a header (<h1>) labeled 'Rock, Paper, Scissors Game'. Add three buttons for player choices (Rock, Paper, and Scissors) and placeholders (<span>) to display the player's choice, the computer's choice, and the game result. Test the page in a browser to ensure all elements appear correctly.
