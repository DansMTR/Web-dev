Convert the game into a two-player mode. Instead of playing against the computer, allow Player 1 to select their choice first, then allow Player 2 to select their choice. Once both players have chosen, determine the winner and update their scores. Modify the game so that Player 1's choice remains hidden until Player 2 makes their selection. Display a question mark (?) instead of Player 1’s choice and reveal it only after Player 2 picks. Ensure the game resets properly and allows for continuous play. Test the two-player functionality to confirm that turns switch correctly and Player 1’s choice remains hidden until Player 2 has chosen.
